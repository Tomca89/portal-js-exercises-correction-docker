For this exercise, you will learn about classes and objects. 

Context: Your employer, Rocket Cars has asked you to keep track of its new dealership, your boss is getting tired of filling everything by hand on excell sheets.

Rocket cars wants you to create a class that will act as a "Template" for an object that will represent the dealership.

You must create a class that represents these attributes:
- the average number of cars sold per day ( attribute name: average_sold)
- the number of cars currently in the dealership ( attribute name: cars_inside)
- the address of the dealership ( attribute name: address)
- the number of employees ( attribute name: number_employees)

your boss also wants you to create a method that will calculate the percentage of people on cars in the dealership

to do so:

	divide the number of cars inside the dealership by the number of employees and multiply the result by 100
	
	if the number is not even, you must round it using Math.round()
	
	the result should be a number between 0 and 100,
	
	return the result in a method called caculateRatio()



Dealership:

	-Average number of cars sold per day: 5
	-Cars inside the dealership: 252
	- Employees: 15
	- Address: 4468 rue wellington


Example of a class:

class Car { --Define the name of the class
  constructor(brand, color){ ---Define the class attributes
    this.brand = brand
    this.color = color
  }

  drive(){ --- method named "drive" that returns a string which contains "vroom vroom"
    return 'vroom vroom'
  }
}


const My_Car = new Car("Ford", "Red") ---> Create a new car object

console.log(My_Car.color) ---> "Red"
console.log(My_Car.brand) ---> "Ford"
console.log(My_Car.drive()) ---> "Vroom Vroom"







Good luck :)
