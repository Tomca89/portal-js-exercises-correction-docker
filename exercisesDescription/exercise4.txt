For this exercise, you will learn about classes and objects. 

Context: Your employer, Rocket Cars has asked you to keep track of its new dealership, your boss is getting tired of filling everything by hand on excell sheets.

Rocket cars wants you to create a class that will act as a "Template" for an object that will represent the dealership.

You must create a class named Dealership that represents these attributes:
- the number of cars currently in the dealership ( attribute name: cars_inside)
- the number of employees ( attribute name: number_employees)

your boss also wants you to create a method called caculateRatio() that will calculate the percentage of people on cars in the dealership

to do so:

	multiply the number of cars inside the dealership by the number of employees and divide the result by 100
	
	if the number is not whole number, you must round it using Math.round()
	
	the result should be a number between 0 and 100,
	
	return the result inside the method


Create an object from this class, named RocketCars using the data below

Dealership:
	- Cars inside the dealership: 252
	- Employees: 15
	Â //result: 38 (37.8)


What is a class ?

A class in javascript is kinda like a "Template" for an object that you will create, when creating an object from this class, your object will inherit all its methods, and you can then fill in the attributes with your data.

take a look at the example below, this example is what a Class representing a car would look like. 



Example of a class:

class Car { --Define the name of the class
  constructor(brand, color){ ---Define the class attributes
    this.brand = brand --- tell javascript that Car.brand and brand inside the constructor are the same
    this.color = color	--- tell javascript that Car.color and color inside the constructor are the same
  }

  drive(){ --- method named "drive" that returns a string which contains "vroom vroom"
    return 'vroom vroom'
  }
}


const My_Car = new Car("Ford", "Red") ---> Create a new car object

console.log(My_Car.color) ---> "Red"
console.log(My_Car.brand) ---> "Ford"
console.log(My_Car.drive()) ---> "Vroom Vroom"







Good luck :)
