Welcome to Jquery Selectors ! previously you learned about QuerySelector in vanilla Javascript. Now it's time to introduce you to the DOM navigation within Jquery.


first off, there are multiple type of selectors available. You can target

- A specific tag 

- A class

- An ID

- A specific tag and its name



HTML:

<p id="test" value="car">Hello world</p>


Here's how to do all of those Using Jquery.



Here's the syntax of a DOM query inside Jquery.

- $('#ID')

- Jquery('#ID')

$ --- to call Jquery

# to specify that we are targeting an ID

Note: if you are targeting a class, use '.class'

- for an ID use #

- for a tag just enter the tag without the <> like for example: <p> becomes 'p'

- for a tag with a certain Name, use the tag and add this, 'tag[name=test]' like for example, a paragraph with the name "MyP", that would be 'p[name=MyP]'



In this exercise, you will create 2 variables, one that holds the Homepage Text and one for the HTMLElement value, but this time, Using Jquery !


again you will have to use the .innerHTML attribute, but this time, you will need to use the Jquery Variation.

this variation is .html() 

so if we combine everything.

<p class="target" id="test" name="ferrari" value="fuel" >My car goes fast !</p>

if you target a class ----> $('.target').html() ----> "My car goes fast"

if you target a class ----> $('.target').val() ----> "fuel"

if you target an id ----> $('#test').html() ---> "My car goes fast"

if you target an id ----> $('#test').val() ----> "fuel"

if you target a tag ---> $('p').html() ----> "My car goes fast"

	Note: if there are multiple tags of the same sort. such as multiple <p> tags in your document. An array is returned, the first tag will be at position 0, and the last one at -1, you can call them like so:

<p class="target" id="test" name="ferrari" value="fuel" >My car goes fast !</p>

<p class="targetted" id="tested" name="tesla" value="electricity" >My car goes even faster !</p>

const myTag = $('p').html() ----> myTag[0] ----> "My Car goes fast" -----> myTag[1] -----> "My car goes even faster !"



Now that you understand the basics of Jquery. We can start working on actual code.



Reminder of your task:


create 2 variables, one that holds the Homepage Text and one for the HTMLElement value, but this time, Using Jquery !
