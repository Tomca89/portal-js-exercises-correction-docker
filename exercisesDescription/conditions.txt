Conditions Exercises:
		
	In this exercise,  if conditions will be the main subject explored.

	Yesterday, employee's at Rocket Cars found out that the business was actually selling more than just cars, they were also selling elevators, and lawn-mowers
	for some reason! 

	Here's what Rocket Cars' employees figured out: 
		
		- Any shop located in Quebec City should be selling elevators.
		- Any shop located in Tampa Bay should be selling lawn-mowers.
		- Any other shop not located in Quebec City nor Tampa Bay should be selling cars.

	
	Here's what's asked of you:

		In a function named: "productCondition", create an if condition that would represent what Rocket Cars' employees figured out.
	
		Also make sure, you are using not only the "if" keyword, but also "else if" and "else".

		For your conditioning, you can use the "location" variable, that has already been created previously, and the RE-Cities.
	
		For the results of your conditioning, you can use the "shopProduct" variable, that has already been created previously, and the RE-Products.


RE-Cities (strings):
	- "Quebec City"
	- "Tampa Bay"
	- others

RE-Products (strings):
	- "elevators"
	- "cars"
	- "lawn-mowers"


Code:
	JS:
		
		function productCondition() {
			
			if (location == "Quebec City") {
				shopProduct = "elevators"
			} else if (location == "Tampa Bay") {
				shopProduct = "lawn-mowers"
			} else {
				shopProduct = "cars"
			}
		}
