Loops Exercise:
	
	Here at Rocket Elevators, we realized that we needed the usage of a for loop to make our elevators go up or down. 
	For that, we hired a developer to add this for loop to our program. I guess that must be you then!

	Here are some things you might need to know to do the job:
		
		You have to create an "elevatorMovement" function.

		In the "elevatorMovement" function, we expect to see an if condition, that conditions wether the "direction" variable is equal to "up" or "down"

		If the direction variable is equal to "up", we expect a for looping going up as long as the current floor is smaller than the end of the floorlist. 
	
		It should be the opposite if the direction variable is equal to "down", as long as the current floor is bigger than the floor 0. 

		As a result of the looping, you can console.log the current floor of each iteration of the loop.

		Keep in mind that if the user is going up, he would start at floor 0, but if he is going down, he'd start at floor 10.





Code: 
	JS:
		

		function elevatorMovement() {

			if (direction == "up") {
				for (i = 0; i < floorlist.length; i++) {
					console.log(floorlist[i])
				}
			} else {
				for (i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
					console.log(floorlist[i])
				}
			}			

		}
