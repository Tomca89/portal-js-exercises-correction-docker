Welcome to this new exercise. In this exercise, you will learn how to display JS values inside HTML.

Your boss wants you to be able to store the message on the website's homepage inside a Javascript variable.

However, your boss wants you to be able to change the String of text any time, inside the Javascript, and have the changes reflected on the website, without touching the HTML.

to do so, you will use Vanilla Javascript to interact with the DOM.


here's an example on how this could be achieved using a simple <p></p> tag in HTML


HTML:

<p id="MyVal" value="sample">This is my sample Paragraph</p>

Now, here we have a small "problem" we have 2 values ! we have "sample" and "This is my sample paragraph".

Let me explain, whatever value you put inside value="" is not the text being showed on screen, rather it's a value assigned to the HTML element itself.

Now let's see how we can grab these 2 values using Javascript.


JS:

document.querySelector('#MyVal').getAttribute('value') ----> "sample"

document.querySelector('#MyVal').innerHTML ---> "This is my sample paragraph"


Now, your boss gave you an HTML file containing a simple Jumbotron with a message. He wants you to store this message inside a variable called message.

Your boss would also like you to store the internal value of the element in a variable called internal.


good luck !
