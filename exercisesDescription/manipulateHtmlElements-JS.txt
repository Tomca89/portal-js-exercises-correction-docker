Exercise ListManipulation: 

	Here at Rocket Cars, we decided to stock our three car models, into a list. Unfortunately, our developer took a random list out on the Internet, and doesn't know
	how to modify it. Here's the list:

	var cars = ["Plane2", "Apples", "Model221"];


	Using Javascript, empty the "cars" list. When the "cars" list is emptied, try and append these three values to the list, in whatever order:

	"model-1"
	"model-2"
	"model-3"
	
	Then, return the "cars" list.

	* Keep in mind that they are multiple ways to empty an array! *


Code: Whatever the way they empty the array, as long as the cars array ends up with "model-1", "model-2", "model-3" (whatever the order)

* while (cars > 0) {
    cars.pop();
  }

* while (cars.length) {
    cars.pop();
  }


* cars.length = 0;

* cars = [];
