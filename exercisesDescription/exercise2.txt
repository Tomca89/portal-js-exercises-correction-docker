Exercise 2: 

	Here is the second exercise you will be assigned with Javascript/JQuery. Previous developers have implemented a form
	used to calculate CodeBoxx's employees salaries. Unfortunately, we realized that some of the fields implemented 
	in the HTML form weren't tested!

	Your job will be to fetch the values of different fields and return the result of the calculation of these fields.
	
	First off, we would ask of you to get the values of the three fields containing the "salary" class.

	Once you got the values of these three fields, addition them together and stock the result of this addition
	into a new variable named: "salariesAddition".

	Then, get the value of the field containing the "tax" id and stock it into a new variable named: "tax".

	When that's done, divide the result of your addition by the variable which was taken from the "tax" id field.

	The result of this division should be stocked in a new variable named: "result", which would be the variable you'll return.

	All of this should be contained in a function named: "salaryCalculator".

	--------
	| 1001 |   class: salary
	--------

	--------
	| 1253 |   class: salary
	--------

	--------
	| 974 |    class: salary
	--------

	--------
	| 5    |  id: tax
	--------


Code:

	JS:

	function salaryCalculator() {
		var salaries = document.getElementsByClassName("salary");

		for (var i = 0; i < salaries.length; i++) {
			console.log(salaries[i].value);
		}

		var salariesAddition = parseInt(salaries[0].value) + parseInt(salaries[1].value) + parseInt(salaries[2].value);
		console.log(salariesAddition);

		var tax = document.getElementById("tax").value;
		console.log(tax);

		var result = salariesAddition / tax;

		return result;
	}
	


Result: 645,60


Challenges: 
	
	1- Since we need to fetch multiple values from a same class, you can loop through the length of the salary class array, 
	   to find the different values.

	2- The addition of the three salary values can be complicated, in the way that you need to specify the addition of each
	   element of your array, as an Integer. But you originally fetch the value as a String.


Tips: 

	1- Use the console.log() function the verify each value. Use your browser's console to access the output of the console.log()
	   function.
