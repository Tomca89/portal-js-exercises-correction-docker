Exercise 1: 

	Here is the first exercise you will be assigned with Javascript/JQuery. Previous developers have implemented a form
	used to calculate CodeBoxx's employees salaries. Unfortunately, we realized that some of the fields implemented 
	in the HTML form weren't working!

	Your job will be to implement four (4) functions, one for each type of calculation with the name of the functions
	being the type of calculation: addition, substraction, multiplication, division.

	Using whatever value, each function should have two parameters, and return a Integer or a Decimal value.

	For each function, you are required to call it once, and to use the console.log function to print the return values into your
	browser's console.

Code:

	JS:

		function addition(a, b) {
			var additionResult = a + b;
			console.log(additionResult);
			return additionResult;
		}

		function substraction(a, b) {
			var substractionResult = a - b;
			console.log(substractionResult);
			return substractionResult;
		}

		function multiplication(a, b) {
			var multiplicationResult = a * b;
			console.log(multiplicationResult);
			return multiplicationResult;
		}

		function division(a, b) {
			var divisionResult = a / b;
			console.log(divisionResult);
			return divisionResult;
		}

		addition(1, 5);
		substraction(1.5, 0.3);
		multiplication(3, 5);
		division(5, 2.5);


Tips: 

	1- Use the console.log() function the verify each value. Use your browser's console to access the output of the console.log()
	   function.
