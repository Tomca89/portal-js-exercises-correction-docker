Exercise 3:

	Your employer, Rocket Cars, has asked you to keep track of its new dealership. Your boss is getting tired of filling everything by hand on Excel sheets.

	Rocket Cars wants you to create a function to calculate how many weeks it would take to sell all their cars.
	You must create 2 variables that'll represent: 
	
	- The average number of cars sold per day
	- The number of cars currently in the dealership 


	Your function must be named 'SalesCalculator' and has to return a number which represents the amount of weeks it would take to sell all their cars.

	To do so: divide **the number of cars in the dealership** by **the average number of cars sold per day Multiplied by 5**.

	Your function must return the result of this equation.

	Good luck :)


Code:
	JS:
		function SalesCalculator {
		
			var averageCarsSoldByDay = 10;
			var numberCarsInTheDealership = 200;

			var result = numberCarsInTheDealership / averageCarsSoldByDay * 5;
		
			return result;
		};
